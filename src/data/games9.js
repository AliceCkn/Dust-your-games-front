    "description": "<p>Find adventure in this marvelous asymmetric game. Root provides limitless replay value as you and your friends explore the unique factions all wanting to rule a fantastic forest kingdom. Play as the Marquise de Cat and dominate the woods, extracting its riches and policing its inhabitants, as the Woodland Alliance, gathering supporters and coordinate revolts against the ruling regime, the Eyrie Dynasties, regaining control of the woods while keeping your squabbling court at bay, or as the Vagabond, seeking fame and fortune as you forge alliances and rivalries with the other players. Each faction has its own play style and paths to victory, providing an immersive game experience you will want to play again and again.</p>",
    "commentary": "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
    "faq": "<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned \"Reach Value\" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"w-50\" src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'AMEwdJGV5c', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).

    "description": "<p><em>Scythe</em> gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

    "description_preview": "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. "

    "description": "<p><em><strong>Wingspan</strong></em> is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p>You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your aviary. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors</li>\r\n<li>Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.</p>",
    "commentary": "<p>Wingspan's artists, Ana and Natalia, have been friends since high school in Colombia. After Natalia moved to the U.S., she ran into <a href=\"/designer/MANNUPclkd/alan-stone\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Stone</a> through their kids' school, which led to her getting connected with <a href=\"/designer/QIz5pAPzFk/jamey-stegmaier\" target=\"_blank\">Jamey Stegmaier</a> of <a href=\"/publisher/njVFVNfJc7/stonemaier-games\" target=\"_blank\">Stonemaier Games</a>. Check out this interview <a href=\"/forum/XTO9WbDBqe/how-the-best-board-game-of-2019-wingspan-reunited-two-high-school-friends-interview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\r\n<p>In an interview, designer <a href=\"/designer/UBhK4cSEV6/elizabeth-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Hargrave</a> commented that she felt &quot;... there were too many games about castles and space, and not enough games about things I'm interested in. So I decided to make a game about something I cared about.&quot;</p>",
    "faq": "<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rulebook is well-organized and easy to follow. You can learn how to play the game after reading through 10 pages of rules accompanied by plenty of visual cues and breathing space between text. Alternatively, you can use the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of the Appendix) if you want to learn the game in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran gamers will find it relatively easy to learn and teach, while new gamers may feel that it's more complex than what they're used to. When it comes to learning the actual strategy, the game will likely \"click\" for the majority of the players by the time your group finishes the 1st Round (there are 4 Rounds total).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the game's simple turn structure and types of actions available, you'll quickly pick up on how the game works by watching your friends play. So while you may not be playing optimally or finding the best combos to pull off, you'll likely feel comfortable by the start of Round 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who've played Stonemaier Games' <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/7NYbgH2Z2I/viticulture-essential-edition\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '7NYbgH2Z2I', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Viticulture: Essential Edition</a>, Wingspan is less complex than Viticulture in terms of strategy elements and has fewer rules to memorize. If you have detailed questions about the game, you'll likely find an answer within this <a href=\"https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/rules/\">comprehensive FAQ</a> put together by Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it good for 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>2-player gameplay won't trigger pink bird powers as frequently, which are activated once per turn if a criteria is met during an opponent's turn (e.g. get \"X\" benefit when another player does \"Y\" action). There will also be less competition for valuable birds cards or for the food dice from the birdfeeder.</p>\r\n<p>Wingspan is a relatively low interaction game. This means that the gameplay won't feel much different at low or high player counts and makes for an easily scalable game. So if you love Wingspan at high player counts, you'll love it at 2-player count as well. On the other hand, if you're someone who prefers highly interactive games where your actions directly impact another player's strategies, you should try it out before making the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is there a hand limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play alone?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with most Stonemaier Games titles, Wingspan comes with a separate set of rules for the Automa, an AI opponent that simulates playing against a human opponent. This game was rated #13 on \"2020 People's Choice Top 200 Solo Games.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first player is randomnly selected by your group. That player gets the first-player token and will kick off the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player with the most points wins. Tally up points for the following and determine the winner:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Points based on bird cards played on your tableau</li>\r\n<li>Points for bonus card(s) accomplished</li>\r\n<li>Points for end-of-round goals</li>\r\n<li>1 point for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Egg on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Food token cached on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Card tucked under a bird card</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In case of a tie, number of unused food tokens serve as tiebreaker. If still tied, they share the victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's inside the box?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>170 unique bird cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>26 bonus cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>16 Automa cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>103 food tokens</li>\r\n<li>75 egg miniatures</li>\r\n<li>5 custom wooden dice</li>\r\n<li>5 player mats</li>\r\n<li>1 birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>2-piece Game Trayz custom tray</li>\r\n<li>1 goal mat</li>\r\n<li>8 goal tiles</li>\r\n<li>1 first-player token</li>\r\n<li>40 action cubes (8 per player)</li>\r\n<li>1 scorepad (50 sheets; 1 sheet used for all players each game)</li>\r\n<li>3 rulebooks</li>\r\n</ul>",

Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth: \r\n \r\n Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower \r\n Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors \r\n Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them \r\n \r\n The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.

    "description": "<p><strong>Gloomhaven</strong> is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.<br /><br />Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br /><br />This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>",
    "commentary": "<p>After the 1st Kickstarter raised $386,104 from 4,904 backers, this 22 lb monster of a box opened to critical acclaim and went onto raise another $4M from over 40,000 backers for its second print run.</p>",

This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

    "description": "<p>In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins.</p>",
    "commentary": "<p>FryxGames, the makers of Terraforming Mars, is a family business run by 5 brothers out of a family of 10 brothers, 6 sisters, and 2 parents. Even outside of the 5 brothers, most of the family is involved in the creation process one way or the other.</p>",

    "description_preview": " In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins. "

    "description": "<p><strong>Azul</strong> was designed by the world famous, award-winning game author Michael Riesling. Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game.</p>\r\n<p>Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora. By carefully drafting the correct Quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process.</p>\r\n<p>Introduced by the moors, &quot;azulejos&quot; (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The King, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own Palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles.</p>\r\n<p>As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora.</p>",

    "description_preview": "  Azul  was designed by the world famous, award-winning game author Michael Riesling. Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game. \r\n Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora. By carefully drafting the correct Quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process. \r\n Introduced by the moors, \"azulejos\" (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The King, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own Palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. \r\n As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora.

    "description": "<p>After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants &amp; Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Pandemic</strong></em>, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are <em>Epidemic!</em> cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!</p>\r\n<p>The 2013 edition of <em>Pandemic</em> includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.</p>\r\n<h4>Artists:</h4>\r\n<p>Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration)</p>\r\n<p>Régis Moulun (cover painting)</p>\r\n<p>Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)<br /><br /><br /></p>",

    "description_preview": " After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants & Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    "

    "description": "<p>Powerful Spirits have existed on this isolated island for time immemorial. They are both part of the natural world and - at the same time - something beyond nature. Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been &quot;discovered&quot; by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late!</p>",

    "description_preview": " Powerful Spirits have existed on this isolated island for time immemorial. They are both part of the natural world and - at the same time - something beyond nature. Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been \"discovered\" by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late! "
